We are interested in investigating trends related to traffic fatalities in the United States. We will examine trends depending on states, cities, weather conditions, types of vehicles, etc. To answer these questions, we will use the "Traffic Fatalities" dataset provided by the US public transportation website (also found in Kaggle).
